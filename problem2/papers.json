    "abstract": "Recent works attribute the capability of in-context learning (ICL) in large\npre-trained language models to implicitly simulating and fine-tuning an\ninternal model (e.g., linear or 2-layer MLP) during inference. However, such\nconstructions require large memory overhead, which makes simulation of more\nsophisticated internal models intractable. In this work, we propose an\nefficient construction, Transformer in Transformer (in short, TinT), that\nallows a transformer to simulate and fine-tune complex models internally during\ninference (e.g., pre-trained language models). In particular, we introduce\ninnovative approximation techniques that allow a TinT model with less than 2\nbillion parameters to simulate and fine-tune a 125 million parameter\ntransformer model within a single forward pass. TinT accommodates many common\ntransformer variants and its design ideas also improve the efficiency of past\ninstantiations of simple models inside transformers. We conduct end-to-end\nexperiments to validate the internal fine-tuning procedure of TinT on various\nlanguage modeling and downstream tasks. For example, even with a limited\none-step budget, we observe TinT for a OPT-125M model improves performance by\n4-16% absolute on average compared to OPT-125M. These findings suggest that\nlarge pre-trained language models are capable of performing intricate\nsubroutines. To facilitate further work, a modular and extensible codebase for\nTinT is included.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be incredibly\neffective for offline reinforcement learning (RL) by representing the\ntraditional RL problem as a sequence modelling problem (Chen et al., 2021;\nJanner et al., 2021). However many of these methods only optimize for high\nreturns, and may not extract much information from a diverse dataset of\ntrajectories. Generalized Decision Transformers (GDTs) (Furuta et al., 2021)\nhave shown that utilizing future trajectory information, in the form of\ninformation statistics, can help extract more information from offline\ntrajectory data. Building upon this, we propose Skill Decision Transformer\n(Skill DT). Skill DT draws inspiration from hindsight relabelling (Andrychowicz\net al., 2017) and skill discovery methods to discover a diverse set of\nprimitive behaviors, or skills. We show that Skill DT can not only perform\noffline state-marginal matching (SMM), but can discovery descriptive behaviors\nthat can be easily sampled. Furthermore, we show that through purely\nreward-free optimization, Skill DT is still competitive with supervised offline\nRL approaches on the D4RL benchmark.

Empirically, we show that the extra directionality information is\nuseful in various downstream tasks, including correctness testing of sorting\nnetworks and source code understanding.

Our sampled\ntransformer introduces random element sampling, which randomly splits point\nsets into subsets, followed by applying a shared Hamiltonian self-attention\nmechanism to each subset. The overall attention mechanism can be viewed as a\nHamiltonian cycle in the complete attention graph, and the permutation of point\nset elements is equivalent to randomly sampling Hamiltonian cycles. This\nmechanism implements a Monte Carlo simulation of the $O(n^2)$ dense attention\nconnections. We show that it is a universal approximator for continuous\nset-to-set functions. Experimental results on point-clouds show comparable or\nbetter accuracy with significantly reduced computational complexity compared to\nthe dense transformer or alternative sparse attention schemes.",
